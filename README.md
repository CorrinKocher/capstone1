This was the first application I created with a pair programmer (just 4 weeks into the .NET bootcamp at TechElevator). 
It was a great way to to practice OOP and getting information from the client to a file and vice versa, and writing Unit Tests. 
The objective was to take in catering orders in through the User Interface, check the availability of that item, 
complete transactions and also log the completed transactions into a file.
